Flowering time in pea: a systems biology approach from the genetic network to the field
======
Pea (_Pisum sativum_) is a leguminous crop grown for human and animal consumption, whose cultivated areas are declining in Europe, particularly because of insufficient productivity. Inra has been seeking to develop a high performance winter pea, which would be characterized by a more stable and higher yield than currently grown spring and winter pea. The date of flowering is at the heart of this strategy with flower initiation is a primordial phase of development after which the plant is sensitive to environmental conditions, especially frost. The preferred approach is the manipulation of the flowering date using the different alleles known for the key flowering genes. A predictive model of the flower initiation date based on the genotype and environmental conditions, can be used to describe the ideal genotype for winter pea that would meet the needs of breeders.

My thesis work aimed at developing an integrative tool combining the range of data available at different scales in the form of a mathematical model of the flowering date in pea.
