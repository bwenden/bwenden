**Abstract**: Many key phenological stages of temperate fruit trees are highly dependent on environmental conditions. This includes the timing of dormancy release and flowering which are essential to ensure good fruit production and quality. Global changes in environmental conditions include warmer winters and higher risks of frosts in the early spring, and may lead to a wide range of problems, including poor flowering, fruit set and cross-pollination, and novel host-pest interaction. In this context, one of the challenges will be to better understand the possible impacts of climate change on flowering and subsequently to breed fruit trees adapted to future climatic conditions. Predictive models for flowering phenology will represent a valuable tool to assist in the process. Following the collection of sweet cherry flowering data recorded across Europe and Australia, we present an exploration of the chill overlap model for several cultivars. The model was tested for a wide range of chill requirement potential values and optimisation results were compared to phenotypic observations. The best fits were obtained for critical chill requirements that do not correspond to the value estimated with forcing experiments. These results highlight that further investigation is needed for both phenological models and experimental analyses of dormancy and flowering in order to develop more robust models based on biologically-sound parameters.
