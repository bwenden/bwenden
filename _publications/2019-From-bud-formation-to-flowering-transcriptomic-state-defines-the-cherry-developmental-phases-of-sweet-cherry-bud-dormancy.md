**Abstract**:
 - Bud dormancy is a crucial stage in perennial trees and allows survival over winter to ensure optimal flowering and fruit production. Recent work highlighted physiological and molecular events occurring during bud dormancy in trees and we aimed to further explore the global transcriptional changes happening throughout dormancy progression.

 - Using next-generation sequencing and modelling, we conducted an in-depth transcriptomic analysis for all stages of flower buds in sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars displaying contrasted stages of bud dormancy.

 - We observed that buds in organogenesis, paradormancy, endodormancy and ecodormancy stages are characterised by specific transcriptional states, associated with different pathways. We further identified that endodormancy can be separated in several phases based on the transcriptomic state. We also found that transcriptional profiles of just seven genes are enough to predict the main cherry tree flower bud dormancy stages.

 - Our results indicate that transcriptional changes happening during dormancy are robust and conserved between different sweet cherry cultivars. Our work also sets the stage for the development of a fast and cost effective diagnostic tool to molecularly define the flower bud stages in cherry trees.
