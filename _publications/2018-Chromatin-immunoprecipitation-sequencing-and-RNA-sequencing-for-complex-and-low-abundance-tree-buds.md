**Abstract**: Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a robust technique to study interactions between proteins, such as histones or transcription factors, and DNA. This technique combined with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to better understand biological processes in eukaryotes. We developed a combined ChIP-seq and RNA-seq protocol for tree buds (*Prunus avium L.*, *Prunus persica*, *Malus x domestica Borkh.*) that has also been successfully tested in *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Tree buds contain phenolic compounds that negatively interfere with ChIP and RNA extraction. In addition to solving this problem, our protocol is optimised to work on small amounts of material. In this protocol, samples for ChIP-seq are cross-linked after flash freezing, making it possible to work on trees growing in the field and to perform ChIP-seq and RNA-seq on the same starting material, differentiating it from previously published protocols. This protocol will allow analysis of chromatin and transcriptomic dynamics in tree buds, notably during its development and response to the environment.
